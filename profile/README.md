## About us

![Icons](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,rust,htmx,gtk,latex,)


**The Dawson High Energy Physics** club, run by Dr. Manuel Toharia Zapata is a place for curious college students to learn more about particle physics.
Every week, students from a wide variety of programs meet to learn and discuss about flavour physisc, extra dimensions and much more. 
We engage with both theory and experiments, learning about and observing particles. Our many projects include an Alpha particle detector, spark chamber, Scintillating Chamber, and more.

## Our Projects
- [Scintillating Chamber](#the-scintillating-chamber)
- [Opentrig](#opentrig)
- Alpha particle detector
- Higgs Data Analysis



### The Scintillating Chamber

Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/Yp-H1ZBjPuM) about our The Scintillating Chamber!

**The Scintillating Chamber** is our winning proposal to the 2025 [Beamline for Schools](https://beamlineforschools.cern/) competition. It consists of an arrangement of scitillator rods to detect and model the trajectory of cosmic muons in three dimensions. The possible trajectories are then calculated and displayed graphically to the user.

**See Paper [HERE](./proposal/proposal.pdf)** or on the **[BL4S winners' page](https://beamline-for-schools.web.cern.ch/2025-edition)**


### Opentrig

**Opentrig** is an extension of The Scintillating Chamber. After our proposal was declared one of the winners of the 2025 Beamline for Schools competition, 
we decided to create a new prototype of our detector, that was more reliable and better adapted to the requirements of our experiments at [DESY](https://desy.de/index_eng.html). 
At the heart of this new prototype is Opentrig, a 24-channel digital acquisition system with variable input thresholding that served as our data acquisition system during our experiments at DESY.
